## What is Saturday Hack Night?

Saturday Hack Night is not just your regular hackathon. Here, we will be building solutions / applications via API integration.
* The needed resource, the respective API and documentation will be shared with you once you register. And remember this is a one time registration! If you have registered once, you need not have to repeat it again for the next.
* API for this week is Notion API.

## Notion API
Notion Integrations can be built using Notion APIs. These Integrations can connect services to Notion and build interactive experiences for users within Notion. 

Here are some cool ideas as sample.You can either modify these problem statements in your own way or else you can come up with your own brainstorming super cool ideas.
